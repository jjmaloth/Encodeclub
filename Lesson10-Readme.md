Lesson 10 - TokenSale.sol
Challenge explanation

    Smart Contract Features
        Buy ERC20 tokens with ETH for a fixed ratio
            Ratio r means that 1 ETH should buy r tokens
        Withdraw ETH by burning the ERC20 tokens at the contract
        Mint a new ERC721 for a configured price
            Price p means that 1 NFT should cost p tokens
        Allow users to burn their NFTs to recover half of the purchase price
        Update owner withdrawable amount whenever a NFT is sold
        Allow owner to withdraw tokens from the contract
            Only half of sales value is available for withdraw
