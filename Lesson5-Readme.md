Getting started with our development environment

    Recommendation: Before starting, make sure that you have the correct version of Node installed in your system.

        You can check your current version by running node -v in your terminal.

    Use Node Version Manager to install and use Node v20 LTS version to avoid problems

nvm install --lts
...
nvm use --lts
...
node -v
v20.11.1

    Note: on windows the nvm command is not available, use nvm-windows instead from Corey Butler's community package.

# For windows
nvm install lts
...
nvm use lts
...
node -v
v20.11.1

Lets start by cloning OpenZeppelin contracts repository:

git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts.git
cd .\openzeppelin-contracts\
npm install

    Note: You might see some warnings, but that's ok. You can ignore anything that is not an error, even vulnerability warnings (for now).

        Note 2: on windows the scripts/prepare.sh might give an error. This is not a problem for running the project.

Output example

npm run compile
...
> openzeppelin-solidity@5.0.2 compile
> hardhat compile
...
Compiled 231 Solidity files successfully

Package.json scripts

    "scripts": {
      "compile": "hardhat compile",
      ...
      "test": "hardhat test",
      ...
    },

Test example

npm run test ./test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js
...
> openzeppelin-solidity@5.0.2 test
> hardhat test ./test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js
...
126 passing (5s)

    Note: on Windows the paths should use \ instead of /, for example: .\test\token\ERC20\ERC20.test.js

Breaking change

Open a file to edit:

code ./contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol

Change line 78:

    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        return 42;
    }

Run the test again:

npm run test ./test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js
...
> openzeppelin-solidity@5.0.2 test
> hardhat test ./test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js
...
  124 passing (6s)
  2 failing

  1) ERC20
       $ERC20
         has 18 decimals:

      AssertionError: expected 42 to equal 18.
      + expected - actual

      -42
      +18
      
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js:47:48)
      at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)

  2) ERC20
       $ERC20ApprovalMock
         has 18 decimals:

      AssertionError: expected 42 to equal 18.
      + expected - actual

      -42
      +18
      
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js:47:48)
      at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)

Steps

    Creating a new project named project:

# Exit your working folder:
cd ..
# Alternatively you could pick a directory in another place, like "cd ~/desktop" or any other you may prefer
# Create a new folder called "project" or any other name of your choice
mkdir project
# Enter that folder
cd project
# Make sure that your folder is not inside any other project folder in your device
# For example, check if don't have any other files named "package.json" in any of the directories above your current directory

    Initializing a repository:

    Hardhat is used through a local installation in your project.

        This way your environment will be reproducible, and you will avoid future version conflicts.

This requires initializing a repository with npm or yarn before proceeding

    Starting a new project using npm:

npm init
# After running this, complete the prompt with the default options (hit enter for every option)
# These options can be changed later in the package.json file

    Installing hardhat locally using npm:

npm install --save-dev hardhat
# Complete the prompt with the default options (hit enter for every option)
# These options can be changed later in the package.json file

    Note: To use bun or yarn instead of npm, you can run bun add -d <name of package> or yarn add --dev <name of package> instead of npm install --save-dev <name of package> to install dependencies, and you can use bun <command> or yarn <command> instead of npx <command> to run packages.

    Initializing Hardhat:

npx hardhat init
    "Create a TypeScript project (with Viem)"
# Pick all default options
code .

    Note: Depending on your system and/or your package manager, hardhat will automatically install all the dependencies in the same command. Sometimes it won't install them, but instead it will just output a list of suggested dependencies versions in your terminal.

Recommended extensions

Mocha Test Explorer

Hardhat
Environment setup for VSCode tests

    For our tests extension to work, we need to create a configuration file for it
        This configuration file will not be there when you initialize the repo, you must create it
    Create a file named exactly .mocharc.json in the root of your project folder with the following contents:

{
  "require": "hardhat/register",
  "timeout": 40000,
  "_": ["test*/**/*.ts"]
}

    For storing our personal credentials and environment variables, we need to create an environment file for it
        This file will not be there when you initialize the repo, you must create it
    Create a file named exactly .env in root project folder with the following contents:

MNEMONIC="here is where your extracted twelve words mnemonic phrase should be put"
PRIVATE_KEY="<your wallet private key should go here>"
POKT_API_KEY="********************************"
INFURA_API_KEY="********************************"
INFURA_API_SECRET="********************************"
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="********************************"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="********************************"

    Note: you may choose as many RPC providers as you want, but you must have at least one.

        Having more RPC providers can be useful as fallback options in case one of them is down. For POKT you can create one free key in each provider available in their network too.

Edit the environment with your keys, and make sure that this file is in your .gitignore file.

    Do never share your .env file with anyone that you don't trust.

        If you end up revealing your private keys you may lose all your assets, even if you were using testnets, since your wallet is the same regardless of the network you are connected to.

    Test if your hardhat configuration is working :

npx hardhat compile 
npx hardhat test 

Hardhat task example

    Create an Accounts task in hardhat.config.ts file:

import { task, type HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
...
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
  const accounts = await hre.viem.getWalletClients();
  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.account.address);
  }
});

    Test the new task:

npx hardhat accounts

Clearing template files

rm ./contracts/*
rm ./ignition/*
rm ./test/*
npx hardhat clean

    You can also remove the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file if you want to start fresh. Just remember to run npm install or yarn install to install the dependencies again next time.

        This can be useful if you want to use this folder as a starting point for your next projects in the bootcamp.
