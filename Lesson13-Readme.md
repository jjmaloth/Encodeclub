Creating the project

    Install yarn if you don't have it

corepack enable

    Clone the initial project base

git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git

    Initialize the project

cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install

    Start the application

yarn start

    Note: If you navigate to http://localhost:3000/ you will see the UI in place, but with some errors since there is no local chain running yet.

    To fix that, you could configure the project to point to a public blockchain, or you could run a local chain in your development environment.

    Configuring the application chain

code ./packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts

Now change targetNetworks: [chains.hardhat] to [chains.sepolia] or any other.

The problem of using public networks is that it makes the development experience very slow.

This is why we will use a local chain for development.

    Running a local chain

Open another terminal window in the same folder or split your current terminal.

yarn chain

    Testing with a sample contract

Open another terminal window in the same folder or split your current terminal.

yarn deploy

Using your own contract

    Contract code for HelloWorld.sol

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string private text;

    constructor() {
        text = "Hello World";
    }

    function helloWorld() public view returns (string memory)  {
        return text;
    }

    function setText(string memory newText) public {
        text = newText;
    }
}

    Create a new deployment script named 01_deploy_hello_world.ts at packages/hardhat/deploy

import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { DeployFunction } from "hardhat-deploy/types";

const deployHelloWorld: DeployFunction = async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const { deployer } = await hre.getNamedAccounts();
  const { deploy } = hre.deployments;

  await deploy("HelloWorld", {
    from: deployer,
    log: true,
    autoMine: true,
  });
};

export default deployHelloWorld;

deployHelloWorld.tags = ["HelloWorld"];

    Run deployment again

yarn deploy

Updating the Home Screen

    Open the Home page to edit

code ./packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx

import type { NextPage } from "next";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="flex items-center flex-col flex-grow pt-10">
        <div className="px-5">
          <h1 className="text-center mb-8">
            <span className="block text-2xl mb-2">Welcome to</span>
            <span className="block text-4xl font-bold">Scaffold-ETH 2</span>
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center text-lg">
            Get started by editing{" "}
            <code className="italic bg-base-300 text-base font-bold max-w-full break-words break-all inline-block">
              packages/nextjs/pages/index.tsx
            </code>
          </p>
          <PageBody />
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

function PageBody() {
  return (
    <>
      <p className="text-center text-lg">Here we are!</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default Home;

    Usually new components are created inside new files, organized under separated folders, but for simplicity we are adding it directly to the page for this example.

Blockchain integration

    Adding a hook to read the contract

"use client";
import { useScaffoldReadContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

    Create a new component for reading the contract

function ExampleContractRead() {
  const {
    data: helloWorld,
    isPending,
    isError,
    dataUpdatedAt,
  } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "HelloWorld",
    functionName: "helloWorld",
  });

  if (isPending) return <p className="text-center text-lg">Loading...</p>;
  if (isError) return <p className="text-center text-lg">Error getting information from your contract</p>;

  return (
    <>
      <p className="text-center text-lg">The text from the contract is {helloWorld}</p>
      <p className="text-center text-sm">This data was last updated at {new Date(dataUpdatedAt).toLocaleString()}</p>
    </>
  );
}

    Display the component in the page below PageBody

          ...
          </p>
          <PageBody />
          <ExampleContractRead />
        </div>
        ...

Understanding Scaffold-ETH Blockchain Integration

    Scaffold-ETH 2 uses the Reown WalletKit (formely known as WalletConnect) to connect to the blockchain
    When setting up a project with Scaffold ETH,you can modify the scaffold.config.ts file to use your own Project ID configuration
        Create an account in the Reown Cloud
        Create a project and copy the Project ID
        Create an entry for the NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID in your project .env file or in your device environment variables, and place the Project ID value there
    It's possible to create a whole app using the AppKitcomponent in any EVM chain
        You can check a demonstration of the AppKit implementation for NextJS with Wagmi in this demo project
        If you want to experiment with this project, you can fork it from this StackBlitz example
